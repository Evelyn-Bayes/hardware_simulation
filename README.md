# Custom CPU Simulator

This project simulates a 32-bit CPU with a custom instruction set, registers, and memory model. 

It includes:
- Flat, byte-addressable memory  
- Eight general-purpose registers and a 32-bit program counter  
- A simple instruction set with arithmetic, control flow, and memory access
